# HAERANG-GA
  
Haerang-ga : 해외봉사 이 어플이랑 가자 (Let's go overseas with this application.)
  
### 1. Introduction.  
  
Haerang-ga is an application that allows you to easily look up a database that contains various information about overseas services.

The reason we made this application is that we are interested in volunteering abroad, 
and while we were looking for information, we thought it would be nice to have a platform to collect them in one place 
as there are various sites and information related to overseas volunteering and most of it is scattered, making it difficult to find it at once.
